# Advent Of Code 2024

## How to run
First you need to get your input data from [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) and store it in a text file : `./dayX/input.txt` for the real input and `./dayX/input-test.txt` for the test input.

Then you can run `docker compose run --rm php php "./dayX/dayX.php"`.
